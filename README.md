# We are the team JADY

## Introduction
This game was created by 4 students of UPC, CITM on the Game Design and Development degree.
In this project we will recreate the arcade game Last Resort, 
we will use the sprites of the original game and we will program it from scratch.
You can find all the information and necessary material we used to recreate this game in our repository on Github.

In order to acomplish our mission, we pilot a spaceship with the help of a small drone , the "unit",
and we will defeat all kinds of enemies.
