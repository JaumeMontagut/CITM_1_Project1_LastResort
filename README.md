# Last Resort tribute by team JADY

## Introduction
This game has been created by 4 students of UPC, CITM on the Game Design and Development degree as a tribute to SNK's 1992 game "Last Resort".
We've used the original sprites and programmed the game from scratch in c++.
You can find all the information and necessary material we used to recreate this game in our repository on Github.

## About Last Resort
Last Resort immerses us in a world where the apocalypse is approaching and we will try to stop it.
In order to acomplish our mission, we pilot a spaceship with the help of a small drone , the "unit",
and we will defeat all kinds of enemies.
